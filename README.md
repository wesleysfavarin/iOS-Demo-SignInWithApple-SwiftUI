# Sign in with Apple in SwiftUI

Apple's [example project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/adding_the_sign_in_with_apple_flow_to_your_app) for Sign in with Apple is built with UIKit. In this project, I wrapped the button and the behaviour that goes with it in a SwiftUI component.

You need to do some setup in your developer account to issue sign in requests. Refer to [Apple's documentation](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devde676e696) for guidance with the necessary steps. I had to jump some hurdles to get that working, which I wrote down in [this blogpost](https://medium.com/q42-engineering/sign-in-with-apple-e45325cd9d0).
